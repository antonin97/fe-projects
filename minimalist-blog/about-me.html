                <p class="p-about-me">I used to be a pack rat. I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate
                any of it because there was too much.</p>
                <p><strong>Things were terrible.</strong> I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a
                relationship.</p>
                <h6>How I turned things around</h6>
                <p>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything. <strong>I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage</strong>,
                sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.</p>
                <p>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p>
                <h6>Now I live the simple life</h6>
                <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. <strong>I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more</strong>, and I have
                more free time to enjoy.</p>
